# 01. Evolution of Prompt Engineering

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to guide the behavior of language models. As models have grown in capability, prompt engineering has evolved from simple queries to sophisticated techniques for controlling outputs and task performance.

## 1. Early Prompting Approaches

- **Direct Queries:** Early language models responded to simple, direct prompts (e.g., "Translate 'cat' to French").
- **Template-Based Prompts:** Use of fixed templates to elicit specific responses.

### Example
```
Translate English to French: cat ->
```

## 2. Emergence of Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Prompting

- **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing a few input-output examples in the prompt to demonstrate the task.
- **Zero-Shot Prompting:** Providing only instructions, relying on the model's generalization ability.

### Example: Few-Shot Prompt
```
Translate English to French:
cat -> chat
dog -> chien
bird ->
```

## 3. Prompt Engineering for Task Control

- **Instruction Tuning:** Training models on a variety of instructions to improve their ability to follow prompts.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Encouraging the model to reason step-by-step by including intermediate steps in the prompt.
- **Role Assignment:** Assigning roles (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant...") to influence model behavior.

### Example: Chain-of-Thought Prompt
```
Q: If there are 3 cars and each car has 4 wheels, how many wheels are there in total?
A: Each car has 4 wheels. 3 cars * 4 wheels = 12 wheels. Answer: 12
```

## 4. Mathematical Perspective: Prompt as Conditioning

Given a model $`f_\theta`$ and prompt $`P`$:

```math
y = f_\theta(P, x)
```

- The prompt $`P`$ conditions the model's output $`y`$ for input $`x`$.

## 5. Python Example: Prompt Engineering with OpenAI API
```python
import openai

prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant. Answer the following question step by step:
Q: If there are 5 boxes and each box contains 8 apples, how many apples are there in total?
A:
"""

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=30
)
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

## 6. Current Trends and Research

- **Automated Prompt Search:** Using algorithms to find optimal prompts.
- **Prompt Tuning:** Learning soft prompts as continuous embeddings.
- **Prompt Robustness:** Studying how prompt variations affect model outputs.

## Summary
- Prompt engineering has evolved from simple queries to advanced techniques for controlling model behavior.
- Modern prompt engineering includes few-shot, chain-of-thought, and instruction-based prompting.
- Ongoing research explores automated and learnable prompts for even greater control.
