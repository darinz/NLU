# 03. Techniques for Guiding Model Behavior and Responses

## Introduction

Guiding the behavior and responses of language models is a central goal of prompt engineering. This guide covers practical and advanced techniques for influencing model outputs, with explanations, math, and code examples.

## 1. Prompt Design Strategies

### a. Instruction-Based Prompts
- Clearly state the desired task or behavior.
- Example: "Summarize the following text: ..."

### b. Role Assignment
- Assign a persona or role to the model to influence style and tone.
- Example: "You are a helpful assistant."

### c. Contextual Priming
- Provide background information or context to steer responses.
- Example: "Given the following facts..."

### d. Example-Driven Prompts (Few-Shot)
- Include input-output pairs to demonstrate the task.
- Example:
```
Translate English to French:
cat -> chat
dog -> chien
bird ->
```

## 2. Advanced Prompting Techniques

### a. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Encourage step-by-step reasoning by including intermediate steps in the prompt.
- Example:
```
Q: If there are 3 cars and each car has 4 wheels, how many wheels are there in total?
A: Each car has 4 wheels. 3 cars * 4 wheels = 12 wheels. Answer: 12
```

### b. Self-Consistency
- Sample multiple responses and select the most consistent answer.
- Useful for tasks requiring reasoning or creativity.

### c. Prompt Tuning and Soft Prompts
- Learnable prompts (continuous embeddings) prepended to the input to steer model behavior.
- Requires model fine-tuning or special frameworks.

## 3. Mathematical Perspective: Prompt-Conditioned Output

Given a model $`f_\theta`$, prompt $`P`$, and input $`x`$:

```math
y = f_\theta(P, x)
```

- The prompt $`P`$ conditions the model's output $`y`$ for input $`x`$.

## 4. Python Example: Chain-of-Thought Prompting with OpenAI API
```python
import openai

prompt = """
You are a math tutor. Answer step by step:
Q: If a train travels 60 miles in 1 hour, how far will it travel in 3 hours?
A:
"""

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=50
)
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

## 5. Best Practices for Guiding Model Behavior
- Be explicit and specific in instructions
- Use examples to clarify the task
- Assign roles or context as needed
- Experiment with prompt structure and order
- Use advanced techniques (chain-of-thought, self-consistency) for complex tasks

## Summary
- Guiding model behavior relies on prompt design, role assignment, context, and examples.
- Advanced techniques like chain-of-thought and prompt tuning further enhance control.
- Iterative experimentation and prompt refinement are key to effective model guidance.
