# 02. Evaluation Strategies for Real-World NLP Systems

## Introduction

Evaluating NLP systems in real-world scenarios requires strategies that go beyond standard benchmarks. This guide covers practical evaluation strategies, including user-centric, continuous, and task-specific approaches, with math and code examples.

## 1. User-Centric Evaluation
- **User Studies:** Collect feedback from real users through surveys, interviews, or usability tests.
- **Task Success Rate:** Measure the fraction of tasks completed successfully by users.

### Mathematical Formulation: Task Success Rate
Let $`N`$ be the total number of tasks, $`S`$ the number of successful tasks:
```math
\text{Task Success Rate} = \frac{S}{N}
```

### Python Example: Calculating Task Success Rate
```python
results = [True, False, True, True, False, True]
success_rate = sum(results) / len(results)
print(f"Task Success Rate: {success_rate:.2%}")
```

## 2. Continuous and Post-Deployment Evaluation
- **A/B Testing:** Deploy multiple model versions and compare user outcomes.
- **Monitoring:** Track performance, errors, and user feedback in production.
- **Drift Detection:** Identify changes in data distribution over time.

### Python Example: Simple Drift Detection
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

# Simulated feature distributions
train_dist = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
prod_dist = np.random.normal(0.2, 1, 1000)
stat, p_value = ks_2samp(train_dist, prod_dist)
print(f"Drift detected: {p_value < 0.05}")
```

## 3. Task-Specific and Contextual Metrics
- **Custom Metrics:** Define metrics tailored to the application's goals (e.g., response time, coverage, fairness).
- **Contextual Evaluation:** Assess performance in specific user or domain contexts.

## 4. Robustness and Fairness Checks
- **Robustness:** Test with noisy, adversarial, or OOD data.
- **Fairness:** Evaluate across different user groups and sensitive attributes.

## 5. Real-World Effectiveness
- **User Satisfaction:** Collect ratings or qualitative feedback.
- **Error Analysis:** Systematically review failures and edge cases.

## 6. Reporting and Iteration
- **Transparent Reporting:** Document evaluation protocols, metrics, and findings.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Use evaluation results to guide model updates and retraining.

## Summary
- Real-world evaluation strategies include user studies, continuous monitoring, task-specific metrics, and robustness/fairness checks.
- Ongoing, context-aware evaluation is essential for trustworthy NLP deployment.
