# 03. Reporting NLP Experiments for Reproducibility and Reliability

## Introduction

Transparent and thorough reporting of NLP experiments is essential for reproducibility, reliability, and scientific progress. This guide covers best practices for documenting, sharing, and presenting experimental results.

## 1. Essential Elements of Experiment Reporting
- **Research Questions and Hypotheses:** Clearly state the goals and hypotheses.
- **Dataset Details:** Describe sources, splits, preprocessing, and statistics.
- **Model Architecture and Hyperparameters:** Specify all relevant settings and choices.
- **Training and Evaluation Protocols:** Document procedures, random seeds, and evaluation metrics.
- **Results and Analysis:** Present results with appropriate statistical analysis and error bars.

## 2. Reproducibility Checklist
- Provide code and scripts for all experiments.
- Share data or provide download instructions.
- Log all random seeds, software versions, and hardware details.
- Include configuration files (YAML, JSON) for hyperparameters.

## 3. Statistical Reporting
- Report mean and standard deviation over multiple runs.
- Use statistical tests (e.g., t-test, bootstrap) to assess significance.

### Mathematical Formulation: Mean and Standard Deviation
Given results $`x_1, ..., x_n`$:
```math
\text{Mean} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
```
```math
\text{Std} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \text{Mean})^2}
```

## 4. Tables, Figures, and Visualizations
- Use clear tables and plots to present results.
- Include error bars and confidence intervals where appropriate.

### Python Example: Reporting Results with Error Bars
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
means = [0.85, 0.88, 0.90]
stds = [0.01, 0.015, 0.008]
labels = ['Baseline', 'Model A', 'Model B']
plt.bar(labels, means, yerr=stds, capsize=5)
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Model Comparison with Error Bars')
plt.show()
```

## 5. Sharing and Archiving
- Use repositories (e.g., GitHub, Hugging Face) for code and models.
- Archive data and results with persistent identifiers (e.g., DOI, Zenodo).
- Provide detailed README and usage instructions.

## 6. Example: Experiment Reporting Template
```
## Experiment Title
- **Goal:**
- **Dataset:**
- **Model:**
- **Hyperparameters:**
- **Training Procedure:**
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Results:**
- **Analysis:**
- **Reproducibility Checklist:**
```

## Summary
- Thorough reporting ensures experiments can be reproduced and trusted.
- Include all details: data, code, settings, results, and analysis.
- Use statistical rigor and clear visualizations to communicate findings.
