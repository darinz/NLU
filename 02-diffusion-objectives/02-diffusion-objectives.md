# 02. Diffusion Objectives in NLP

## Introduction

Diffusion objectives define the loss functions and training strategies for diffusion models. In NLP, these objectives are adapted to handle the discrete nature of text and to enable effective generative and representation learning.

## 1. The Standard Diffusion Objective

The most common objective is the denoising score matching loss, which encourages the model to predict the noise added at each step:

```math
L = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, \epsilon, t} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \|^2 \right]
```

- $`x_0`$: original data (e.g., word embedding)
- $`\epsilon`$: noise sampled from a standard normal distribution
- $`x_t`$: noisy data at step $`t`$
- $`\epsilon_\theta`$: model's prediction of the noise

## 2. Variants and Extensions for Text

### a. Discrete Diffusion Objectives
- Use Gumbel-softmax or other relaxations to allow gradients to flow through discrete variables.
- Objective is similar, but operates on relaxed (continuous) representations of tokens.

### b. Score-based Generative Modeling
- Learn the score function $`\nabla_{x_t} \log q(x_t)`$ directly.
- Objective:

```math
L = \mathbb{E}_{x_t, t} \left[ \lambda(t) \| s_\theta(x_t, t) - \nabla_{x_t} \log q(x_t | x_0) \|^2 \right]
```

where $`s_\theta`$ is the learned score function.

### c. Conditional Diffusion Objectives
- Condition generation on additional information (e.g., class labels, prompts).
- Objective incorporates conditioning variable $`y`$:

```math
L = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, y, \epsilon, t} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, y) \|^2 \right]
```

## 3. Python Example: Denoising Loss

Below is a simplified example of computing the denoising loss for embeddings:

```python
import numpy as np

def denoising_loss(x0, model, betas, T):
    loss = 0
    for t in range(T):
        noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=x0.shape)
        xt = np.sqrt(1 - betas[t]) * x0 + np.sqrt(betas[t]) * noise
        pred_noise = model(xt, t)  # Dummy model function
        loss += np.mean((noise - pred_noise) ** 2)
    return loss / T

# Dummy model for illustration
model = lambda xt, t: np.zeros_like(xt)
embedding_dim = 8
x0 = np.random.randn(embedding_dim)
betas = np.linspace(0.0001, 0.02, 10)
loss = denoising_loss(x0, model, betas, T=10)
print(loss)
```

## 4. Evaluation Metrics

- **Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL):** Measures how well the model fits the data.
- **Sample Quality:** BLEU, ROUGE, or human evaluation for generated text.
- **Diversity:** Metrics like Self-BLEU to assess variety in outputs.

## Summary
- Diffusion objectives guide the training of generative models for text.
- Adaptations are needed for discrete data and conditional generation.
- Proper objectives and evaluation metrics are crucial for success in NLP tasks.
