# 01. Diffusion Models for Text

## Introduction

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to generate data by simulating a gradual noising and denoising process. Originally developed for images, they have recently been adapted for text, enabling new generative and representation learning techniques in NLP.

## 1. What is a Diffusion Model?

A diffusion model consists of two main processes:
- **Forward (Diffusion) Process:** Gradually adds noise to data over several steps until it becomes pure noise.
- **Reverse (Denoising) Process:** Learns to reverse the noising process, reconstructing data from noise.

### Mathematical Formulation

Given data $`x_0`$, the forward process produces a sequence $`x_1, x_2, ..., x_T`$:

```math
q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
```

where $`\beta_t`$ is the noise schedule.

The reverse process is parameterized by a neural network $`p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)`$:

```math
p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))
```

## 2. Adapting Diffusion Models for Text

Text is discrete, so adapting diffusion models requires special techniques:
- **Continuous Relaxation:** Map discrete tokens to continuous embeddings, apply diffusion in embedding space.
- **Score-based Models:** Learn a score function (gradient of log-probability) in continuous space.
- **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs):** Adapted for text by operating on embeddings or using Gumbel-softmax for differentiable sampling.

## 3. Training Objective

The typical objective is to minimize the difference between the true and predicted noise at each step:

```math
L = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, \epsilon, t} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \|^2 \right]
```

where $`\epsilon`$ is the noise added, and $`\epsilon_\theta`$ is the model's prediction.

## 4. Python Example: Diffusion Process in Embedding Space

Below is a simplified example of a forward diffusion process on word embeddings:

```python
import numpy as np

def forward_diffusion(x0, betas, T):
    x = x0.copy()
    for t in range(T):
        noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=x.shape)
        x = np.sqrt(1 - betas[t]) * x + np.sqrt(betas[t]) * noise
    return x

# Example usage
embedding_dim = 8
x0 = np.random.randn(embedding_dim)  # Example word embedding
betas = np.linspace(0.0001, 0.02, 10)
xT = forward_diffusion(x0, betas, T=10)
print(xT)
```

## 5. Challenges and Innovations

- **Discrete Data:** Text is not naturally continuous; requires embedding or relaxation.
- **Mode Collapse:** Ensuring diversity in generated text.
- **Evaluation:** Measuring quality and diversity of generated text is non-trivial.

## Summary
- Diffusion models iteratively add and remove noise to generate data.
- For text, they operate in embedding space or use continuous relaxations.
- They enable powerful new generative and representation learning techniques in NLP.
