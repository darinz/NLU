# 03. Applications of Diffusion Models in NLP

## Introduction

Diffusion models are enabling new generative and representation learning techniques in NLP. This guide explores their applications, from text generation to representation learning and beyond.

## 1. Text Generation

Diffusion models can generate realistic and diverse text by reversing a noising process in embedding space or with relaxed discrete variables.

### Example: Conditional Text Generation
- Condition on a prompt or class label to guide generation.
- The model denoises from noise to a coherent text embedding, which is then decoded to text.

#### Python Example (Pseudocode)
```python
# Assume 'diffusion_model' and 'embedding_to_text' are defined
noise = np.random.randn(embedding_dim)
prompt_embedding = get_prompt_embedding('Translate to French: Hello world')
generated_embedding = diffusion_model.sample(noise, condition=prompt_embedding)
generated_text = embedding_to_text(generated_embedding)
print(generated_text)
```

## 2. Representation Learning

Diffusion models can learn robust representations by training to denoise corrupted inputs. These representations can be used for downstream tasks (classification, retrieval, etc.).

### Mathematical Formulation
Given a noisy input $`x_t`$, the model learns to predict the original $`x_0`$ or the noise $`\epsilon`$:

```math
L = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, \epsilon, t} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \|^2 \right]
```

## 3. Data Augmentation

By sampling from intermediate steps of the diffusion process, new data points can be generated for augmentation, improving model robustness.

### Example: Augmenting Text Embeddings
```python
# Sample noisy versions of an embedding for augmentation
x0 = get_embedding('The quick brown fox')
betas = np.linspace(0.0001, 0.02, 10)
noisy_versions = [forward_diffusion(x0, betas, t) for t in range(1, 10)]
```

## 4. Text Inpainting and Editing

Diffusion models can fill in missing parts of text (inpainting) or edit text by denoising from a partially noised input.

### Example: Text Inpainting (Pseudocode)
```python
# Given a masked embedding, denoise to fill in the blanks
masked_embedding = mask_embedding(x0, mask_indices)
inpainted_embedding = diffusion_model.denoise(masked_embedding)
inpainted_text = embedding_to_text(inpainted_embedding)
```

## 5. Challenges and Future Directions
- **Discrete-to-continuous gap:** Improving mapping between text and embedding space.
- **Scalability:** Efficient training and inference for long sequences.
- **Evaluation:** Developing better metrics for generative quality and diversity.

## Summary
- Diffusion models are used for text generation, representation learning, data augmentation, and inpainting in NLP.
- They offer new ways to model and manipulate text data, with ongoing research to address current challenges.
